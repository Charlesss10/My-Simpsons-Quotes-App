# Simpsons Quotes App
This is my first time ever creating a web application using React and AWS Amplify. I'm excited to kick off this proje8ct.

- **Styling**: JavaScript Inbuilt Library and some additional libraries from React

## Getting Started

1. **Install dependencies:**

    ```bash
    cd My-Simpsons-Quotes-App
    npm install -g @aws-amplify/cli
    npx create-react-app my-simpsons-app
    ```

2. **Simpson API Used**
   https://thesimpsonsquoteapi.glitch.me/quotes?count=24
   24 Quotes max. Displayed

4. **Run the development server:**

    ```bash
    npm run dev
    ```

5. **Run the Application:**

    ```bash
    npm build
    npm start
    ```
    Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) in your browser via node.js to see the application.

6. **Database Management**
   I wanted to implement a database to handle different users and login credentials but due to the duration of the project i could not. 


## Folder Structure 
I squeezed everything in one source file. I know that this is not the best practice!!
```
- build
  - index.html
- src
  - App.js: Main routes of the application, Contains Constants and configurations, Contains Utility functions and libraries..
  - App.css
```
