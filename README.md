3. **Run the development server:**

    ```bash
    npm run dev
    ```

4. **Open the Application:**

    ```bash
    npm start
    ```
    Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) in your browser via node.js to see the application.


## Folder Structure 
I squeezed everything in one source file. I know that this is not the best practice!!
```
- src
  - App.js: Main routes of the application, Contains Constants and configurations, Contains Utility functions and libraries..
```
